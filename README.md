|       Hey there! I'm currently working on this game that I've made on my GitHubIO page (amberrpanyt.github.io), but I admit it's not in the best shape right now. The game can only be played on a PC with a display 
|       resolution of 1920 x 1080. Don't worry though, I'm committed to making it better over time through regular updates.
|       I have to admit, coding isn't my strong suit, so I apologize in advance if you encounter any bugs while playing. However, I'm determined to learn and improve, so your patience and support are greatly 
|       appreciated!
|       I hope you'll give the game a try despite its current state, and I promise to make it a more enjoyable experience with each update. Thank you for your understanding, and I'm open to any feedback or suggestions 
|       you might have.
